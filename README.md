## What is this?

This is just a test to show the package react-tag-input to a friend. 

To setup just run:


```
  yarn

```

After everything is installed, to start the development server run

```
yarn run start

```

This is the array in the key `suggestions` that is set in the component state:

```
['Venezuela', 'Francia', 'Alemania', 'Brasil']

```

Everything there is to see is in `index.js` the component provides auto completion using the array `suggestions` mention above. 
And the app will store the selected tag in the key `tags` in the component state.
